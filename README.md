The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is a cutting-edge web tool that uses interactive data visualization to decipher the complex world of microbial diversity. The dashboard uses cutting-edge technologies such as D3.js and Plotly.js to translate complex microbiome data into intuitive, engaging insights. Users can pick individual samples to gain fast access to detailed metadata and dynamic visualizations, such as a bubble chart mapping OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) linkages and a bar chart showcasing the top 10 microbial populations. As users explore among the samples, the dashboard refreshes in real time, providing a seamless and immersive experience for comprehending the microscopic ecosystems within human belly buttons. This platform not only displays powerful data visualization techniques, but it also allows users to discover the amazing intricacy of personal microbiomes through data-driven storytelling.

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is powered by an advanced JavaScript implementation that allows for dynamic data exploration. The init() function is the entry point, getting sample data, loading the dropdown menu with sample IDs, and displaying metadata and visualizations for the first sample. The buildMetadata(sample) function dynamically updates the metadata panel with complete information about the specified sample ID. In addition, buildCharts(sample) creates two crucial visualizations: a bubble chart mapping OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) associations with clickable tooltips, and a bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs for the selected sample. The optionChanged(newSample) event handler orchestrates the complete interactive experience, smoothly updating both metadata and charts whenever a new sample is picked from the dropdown menu, providing users with a fluid and responsive exploration of microbial diversity.
